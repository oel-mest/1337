# 🎓 1337 School Projects

This repository contains my solutions and resources for the [1337 / 42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) curriculum.  
All projects are coded from scratch in **C, C++, and other languages** following the school’s rigorous standards (Norm, Makefiles, error handling, memory management).
